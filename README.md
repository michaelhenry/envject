A command-line tool for injecting environment variables or secrets to any file that has to be compiled especially in iOS.

I have written a [short article](https://www.iamkel.net/posts/6-ios-secrets-handling) regarding this.

And this is inspired by the functionality of [variable-injector](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida/variable-injector) but written in go and not dependent with the swift toolchain version.

## Demo

> This can allow us to prevent hard-coding production keys inside the project. So inside the CI, this can be executed during pre-compilation. And then after that, you can then do the obfuscation to guarantee that no strings are readable.
